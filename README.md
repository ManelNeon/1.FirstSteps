This summer I challenged myself to try and learn C++, the dominant programming language in game development! Although I could learn the syntax and call it a day, anyone that's ever meddled in C++ knows that's not enough! 

I had to dive deep into topics like binary, memory management, and concepts I'd never even thought about before! I had to explore new tools, starting with VSCode, changing to Visual Studio and even trying out a UNIX-like enviroment for the first time! 
All this accompanied by stressful videos full of what seemed like gibberish at first, but as time went on, this "gibberish" started to make more and more sense. 

Connecting this new knowledge with previous one, seeing how it actually worked, laughing at how some problems I had before, are now just that more simple was an amazing experience. 

I also realized how important 𝗽𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 and 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 are! There were moments where Imposter Syndrome did have the best of me, but pushing myself through those moments and learning how to stop and tell myself I 𝑪𝑨𝑵 do it, proved crucial to improving my skillset! 

This all culminated in a simple 𝐓𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐬 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐭𝐨𝐭𝐲𝐩𝐞, centered around pointers, using only 𝐒𝐃𝐋, no engine at all! 

Now I can confidently say I'm comfortable using pointers, memory management and object-oriented programming in C++! I can still learn a lot! But I realized the more I learn, the more there's to learn! I'm ready for it though, bring it on! 💪 

One last note: none of this would have been possible without Inês Lagarto, who introduced me to Tom Pickering. A great teacher and someone who always finds the time to answer my emails, even though most of them are 1000+ words long 🤣 ! 
Both of their support and guidance made a world of difference on this journey!
